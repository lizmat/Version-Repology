NAME
====

Version::Repology - Implement Repology Version logic

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Version::Repology;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `Version::Repology` distribution provides a `Version::Repology` class that encapsulates the logic for creating a `Version`-like object with semantics matching the Repology implementation of [`libversion`](https://github.com/repology/libversion/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#libversion).

In order to avoid any dependencies, this implementation is a pure Raku implementation.

CREDITS
=======

This module is based on the work done by Dmitry Marakasov on the [`libversion`](https://github.com/repology/libversion/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#libversion) project.
