NAME
====

Version::Repology - Implement Repology Version logic

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Version::Repology;

my $left  = Version::Repology.new("1.0");
my $right = Version::Repology.new("1.1");

# object interface
say $left.cmp($right);  # Less

# Infix interface
say $left cmp $right;  # Less
say $left < $right;    # True
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `Version::Repology` distribution provides a `Version::Repology` class that encapsulates the logic for creating a `Version`-like object with semantics matching the Repology implementation of [`libversion`](https://github.com/repology/libversion/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#libversion).

In order to avoid any dependencies, this implementation is a pure Raku implementation.

FEATURES
========

From the `libversion` documentation:

A short list of features
------------------------

  * Simple versions, obviously: 0.9 < 1.0 < 1.1

  * Omitting insignificant components: 1.0 == 1.0.0

  * Leading zeroes: 1.001 == 1.1

  * Unusual separators: 1_2~3 == 1.2.3

  * Letter suffixes: 1.2 < 1.2a < 1.2b < 1.3

Alphanumeric prerelease components:

  * 1.0alpha1 == 1.0.alpha1 == 1.0a1 == 1.0.a1

  * 1.0alpha1 < 1.0alpha2 < 1.0beta1 < 1.0rc1 < 1.0

Awareness of pre-release keywords: alpha, beta, rc, pre

  * while 1.0 < 1.0a-1 (a treated as version addendum)

  * but 1.0alpha-1 < 1.0 (alpha is treated as prerelease marker)

Awareness post-release keywords: patch, post, pl, errata

  * while 1.0alpha1 < 1.0 (alpha is pre-release)

  * but 1.0 < 1.0patch1 < 1.1 (patch is post-release)

Customizable handling of `p` keyword (it may mean either "patch" or "pre").

Logic for checking whether a given version "belongs" to another version logically.

INSTANTIATION
=============

```raku
use Version::Repology;

my $v = Version::Repology.new("1.0");
my $p = Version::Repology.new("1.0", :p-is-patch);
my $a = Version::Repology.new("1.0", :any-is-patch);
my $u = Version::Repology.new("1.0", :upper-bound);
my $l = Version::Repology.new("1.0", :lower-bound);
```

The basic instantion of a `Version::Repology` object is done with the `new` method, taking the version string as a positional argument.

Additionally, the following named arguments can be specified:

:p-is-patch
-----------

If an alphabetic component consists of "p", then assume it's the same as "patch", aka a post-release string. If not specified, or specified with a false value, will consider "p" as a pre-release string (the same as "pre").

:any-is-patch
-------------

Any alphabetic component is assumed as "patch", aka a post-release string. If not specified, or specified with a false value, will consider any alphabetic component as a pre-release string (the same as "pre").

:upper-bound
------------

If in comparison two objects are the same, then select this one as being **higher** in version. Can also be specified as `:bound<upper>`.

:lower-bound
------------

If in comparison two objects are the same, then select this one as being **lower** in version. Can also be specified as `:bound<lower>`.

EXPORTED INFIXES
================

The following `infix` candidates are exported:

  * cmp (return `Order`)

  * == != < <= > >= (return `Bool`)

ALGORITHM
=========

The actual algorithm is described in the [`libversion repository`](https://github.com/repology/libversion/blob/master/doc/ALGORITHM.md).
