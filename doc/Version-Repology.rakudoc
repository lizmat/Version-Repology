=head1 NAME

Version::Repology - Implement Repology Version logic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use Version::Repology;
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Version::Repology> distribution provides a C<Version::Repology>
class that encapsulates the logic for creating a C<Version>-like
object with semantics matching the Repology implementation of
L<C<libversion>|https://github.com/repology/libversion/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#libversion>.

In order to avoid any dependencies, this implementation is a pure
Raku implementation.

=head1 CREDITS

This module is based on the work done by Dmitry Marakasov on the
L<C<libversion>|https://github.com/repology/libversion/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#libversion>
project.
